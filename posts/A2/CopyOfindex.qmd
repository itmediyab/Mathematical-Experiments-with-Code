## A2: Dance Mudra Detection

Sara Saju, Diya Bijoy, Bunyan Usman, Ayush Garg and Sheil Srimany

## Problems we ran into

-   We ran into an issue where the Handpose model detected 43 points instead of 42. To fix this, we removed the "which hand" point from the CSV file, which was causing the extra point.
